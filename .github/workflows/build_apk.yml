    # 1. Setup Java 11 (Required for older Android Builds)
    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '11'

    # 2. Setup Python
    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'

    # 3. Setup Flutter (REQUIRED for Flet 0.22.1 builds)
    - name: Setup Flutter
      uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.19.6' # Matches the Flet 0.22.x era
        channel: 'stable'

    # 4. Install Flet & Dependencies
    - name: Install Python Dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        # Pinning Flet to 0.22.1 forces the Python 3.11 build chain
        pip install flet==0.22.1 flet-audio-recorder numpy tflite-runtime

    # 5. Install Linux Dependencies (Fixes the GTK error)
    - name: Install Linux Dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev libblkid-dev liblzma-dev

    # 6. Accept Android Licenses (The Critical Fix)
    # We use the system's SDK Manager to sign the licenses before Flet tries to run.
    - name: Accept Android Licenses
      run: |
        yes | $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses || echo "Failed to accept licenses via sdkmanager, proceeding anyway..."

    # 7. Build APK
    # We still pipe 'yes' just in case Flet needs to confirm the Flutter install again.
